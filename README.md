# FlyCatching-FPGA
Game written in C for implementation on an FPGA board. Users control a frog and try to catch falling flies. Flies also start to fall with increase velocity and differing direction as time goes on.
The game was written in an online C simulator, CPUlator, and was implemented on a De1-SoC FPGA.

To run the game, go to the following link:
